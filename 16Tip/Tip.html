I received an image of two blurry figures running down the street in the dead of night, lit by neon blue light. I chose to create a simple story of a man being chased by a waiter for stiffing him on the tip. I played around with live background footage with animated characters. I enjoyed the project but I left a lot of editing errors. "

The man sees a Nerf gun on the ground and shoots the waiter to stop him. A chill goes up the waiter's spine as he feels the Nerf bullet. And..."
	
	var SHTL03 = "It kills him. Straight does him in. My man got wasted. Remorseful, the stingy customer pays his respects. He drops a bill in front of the headstone. He salutes as a sad piano plays in the background. Cut to black. It didn't win any awards at the golden globes, I cant imagine why."

I tried to make the light naturally reflect off him, it grew brighter and faded as he ran past the store and lampost. I had a camera turn lined up with the character changing directions at the end of this shot."
